# Polling website using MERN

This is a simple polling website built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node) . This is a web-based polling system that allows users to create and participate in polls. Users can create polls with multiple options, and other users can vote on these polls. Each user can only vote once per poll. The application should also display the results of each poll.

## Frontend (React):

- Create a user-friendly and responsive user interface.
- Implement user authentication for creating and voting on polls.
- Display a list of existing polls on the homepage.
- Create a form to allow users to create new polls with multiple options.
- Show poll details, including options, current votes, and total votes.
- Allow users to vote on a poll.

## Backend (Node.js with Express):

- Develop API endpoints to support CRUD operations for polls.
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Ensure that users can only vote once per poll.
- Calculate and store vote results for each poll.
- Handle errors and validation.

## Database (MongoDB):

- Design a schema to store user data, poll data, and vote data.
- Store user information (e.g., username, email, password hash).
- Store poll information (e.g., question, options, creator, and vote data).
- Ensure data integrity and consistency.

## Features

- Allow users to search for polls by keywords.
- Provide the ability to sort and filter polls based on criteria like date, popularity, etc.
- Display user profiles with their created polls and voting history.
